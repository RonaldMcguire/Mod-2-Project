# Anime encyclopedia
## Description
### This will be a place where all anime fans can gather to find upcoming anime and even see their favorite animes. This will also have some of the most popular anime movies to come out of japan and to update on upcoming anime movies. Throughout the page would love to give quotes of different anime characters and you have to try to guess who said it. Also mixed with a news network on the home page
